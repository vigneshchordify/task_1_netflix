// 18. Grades are computed using a weighted average. Suppose that the written test
// counts 70%, lab exams 20% and assignments 10%.
// If Arun has a score of
// Written test = 81
// Lab exams = 68
// Assignments = 92
// Arunâ€™s overall grade = (81x70)/100 + (68x20)/100 + (92x10)/100 = 79.5
// Write a program to find the grade of a student during his academic year.
// Program should accept the scores for written test, lab exams and assignments
// Output the grade of a student (using weighted average)
// Eg:
// Enter the marks scored by the students
// Written test = 55
// Lab exams = 73
// Assignments = 87
// Grade of the student is 61.8
